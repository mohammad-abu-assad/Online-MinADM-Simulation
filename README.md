# ONLINE-MINADM Algorithm Simulation and Analysis

### Capstone Project - Ort Braude College

This project simulates and analyzes the **ONLINE-MINADM algorithm** for minimizing Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) in optical networks. It implements a dynamic, online solution for managing lightpaths while comparing the performance against the optimal offline solution. The project focuses on two primary network topologies: **path** and **ring**, and provides a detailed analysis of the algorithmâ€™s efficiency using competitive ratios and empirical performance measurements.

## Overview

Optical networks are essential for modern communication, allowing the transmission of large volumes of data over long distances. The ONLINE-MINADM algorithm is designed to dynamically assign wavelengths to lightpaths in such networks to minimize the switching cost, measured in the number of Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs).

This project is divided into two phases:

1. **Phase A**: An in-depth study of the algorithm, exploring its theoretical foundation, competitive ratios, and efficiency in various topologies.
2. **Phase B**: Implementation of a Python program with a graphical interface to simulate the algorithm, compare it with an optimal offline solution, and perform algorithm analysis.

## Algorithm Details

### ONLINE-MINADM Algorithm

The **ONLINE-MINADM algorithm** is an online approach for wavelength assignment in optical networks, aiming to minimize the number of ADMs used, see more details about the algorithm in Capstone Project Phase A-23-1-R-19.

#### Key Features

- **Online Decision-Making**: Makes wavelength assignment decisions as lightpath requests arrive, without knowledge of future requests.
- **Minimizing ADMs**: Efficiently reduces the number of ADMs, leading to cost savings.
- **Support for Multiple Topologies**: Applicable to both path and ring network configurations.

#### How It Works

1. **Initialization**:

   - Set up the network parameters and initialize available wavelengths.

2. **Processing Lightpath Requests**:

   - For each incoming request, assign a wavelength that minimizes the introduction of new ADMs.

3. **ADM Allocation**:

   - Determine ADM placements based on the assigned wavelengths and network topology.

4. **Dynamic Updates**:

   - Update the network state to reflect the new assignments and prepare for subsequent requests.

### Optimal Offline Solution

The optimal offline solution computes the minimum number of ADMs required by considering all lightpath requests collectively.

#### Characteristics

- **Global Knowledge**: Has complete information about all lightpath requests beforehand.
- **Minimum ADM Usage**: Provides a baseline for the lowest possible number of ADMs needed.
- **Benchmarking**: Used to evaluate the efficiency of the online algorithm.

## Analysis and Results

### Competitive Ratio

The **competitive ratio** is used to measure the performance of the online algorithm relative to the optimal offline solution.
see more about the analysis and results in Capstone Project Phase B-23-1-R-19

- **Definition**: Competitive Ratio = (Cost of Online Algorithm) / (Cost of Optimal Offline Algorithm)
- **Interpretation**: A competitive ratio closer to 1 indicates better performance of the online algorithm.

### Empirical Results

#### Simulation Scenarios

- **Variable Network Sizes**: Tested on networks with different numbers of nodes.
- **Traffic Demand Variations**: Analyzed performance under varying volumes and patterns of lightpath requests.
- **Topology Comparison**: Compared results between path and ring topologies.

#### Findings

- **Efficiency**: The ONLINE-MINADM algorithm consistently achieves a competitive ratio within a small constant factor of the optimal.
- **Scalability**: Performance scales well with increased network size and traffic volume.
- **Topology Impact**: The algorithm performs differently on path and ring topologies, with specific competitive ratios for each.

### Visualizations

- **Graphs**:

  - **ADM Usage vs. Number of Lightpaths**: Shows how ADM count increases with more lightpath requests.
  - **Competitive Ratio over Network Sizes**: Illustrates how the competitive ratio changes with network scale.

- **Charts**:

  - **Wavelength Utilization**: Depicts how effectively wavelengths are used.
  - **ADM Distribution**: Visualizes the placement of ADMs across the network.

- **Reports**:

  - Detailed analysis reports are available in the `analysis/reports/` directory.
